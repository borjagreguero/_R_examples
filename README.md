# _R_examples
examples of R - useful codes

This is my collection of R tests and examples I have been gathering through my learning of R. 

Most of the examples are available online from blogs or tutorials without major changes, although some may have been adapted slightly. The original sources are included in each file. 

Note that they are focused on my fields of work and applications.
